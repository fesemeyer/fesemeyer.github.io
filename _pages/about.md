Hi there!

I am a PhD candidate at the International Max Planck Research School on Earth System Modeling in Hamburg, where I am supervised by Johanna Baehr from the [Climate Modeling group](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/workareas/climatemodelling.html) at the University of Hamburg and Christopher Kadow from the Data Analysis group at Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum ([DKRZ](https://www.dkrz.de/en)). My research focuses on the intersection of climate science and computer science, with my thesis provisionally titled "Decadal Climate Predictions with Machine Learning." Currently, I'm working on developing a model to autoregressively predict global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. My ultimate goal is to better understand what makes such models work well for long lead times and better understand predictability on decadal timescales. As I’m still at the beginning of my PhD journey, the specifics of my work might change. As I’m still at the beginning of my PhD journey, the specifics of my work might change.

Over the next few years, my goal is to learn as much as I can about the current state of climate modeling while connecting with like-minded people from around the world. If you work on similar topics, feel free to reach out!

Before starting my PhD journey, I studied computer science at RWTH Aachen University. During my time there, I worked on various projects, including learning algorithms for omega automata and automatic speech recognition. Additionally, I was heavily involved in the student initiative [Team Sonnenwagen Aachen](https://www.sonnenwagen.org/) - a team of 50 students focused on developing, constructing, and racing solar-powered cars. I participated in both the 2019 and 2023 editions of the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in Australia, where I was responsible for developing a velocity optimization software to help the team make strategic decisions during the races. Team Sonnenwagen has been a significant part of my life for many years, and I’m happy to have been featured in a [ZDF documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HCbwgGbqy4) about the 2023 challenge.
